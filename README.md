This is a small framework for creating and viewing web-based presentations.  It
is aimed at authors with some knowledge of web technologies.

There are perhaps three major advantages of web-based presentations.  One is
that they are cross-platform. A second is that a wide range of different types of
resource can be embedded in a presentation, with no need to change programs
while presenting.  A third is that the framework is completely open ended, with
virtually no limit to what can be achieved.

The framework itself provides only a fairly small range of basic features.  The
bulk of the power of the framework comes from the capabilities of browsers and
the embedded integrated technologies guaranteed by the HTML5 standard, all of
which are controllable through scripting.

Examples of resources that can be combined seamlessly into a presentation are
images, videos, audio clips, mathematical notation, program fragments with
syntax highlighting, vector-based drawings, and custom scripted animations. With
a little extra work, interactive quizzes and voting systems, mobile-friendly
materials, uploading of files, live programming demonstrations and much more are
possible. The possibilities expand as browser technology develops. Some of these
possibilities are demonstrated, and more are outlined, in the documentation.
