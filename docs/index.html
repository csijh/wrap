<h1>Wrap</h1>

<p>The Wrap project provides a framework for creating and viewing presentations
using web tools.</p>

<h2 id="server">The web server</h2>

<p>A presentation consists of a few static files, published on any web site,
using any web server. The custom web server can optionally be used for two
purposes.</p>

<p>First, it allows an author to develop a presentation on a local computer,
before publishing somewhere else. This may be to test presentations before
publishing with immediate feedback on any syntax errors, and/or to speed up
development if the publishing process is slow.</p>

<p>Second, it provides a way of making a presentation totally self-contained.
The server can be run on a laptop, and a browser on the same laptop can be used
to view the presentation.  The laptop can then be taken to a venue, with no
dependency on WIFI or mobile networking.  Only a data projector or similar is
needed.</p>

<p>An alternative way of making a presentation self-contained is to run the
browser and visit the presentation web page over the net on a laptop before
leaving for a venue.  If care is taken to ensure that the laptop is kept running
or in sleep mode, that the browser remains running, and that the presentation
page is kept current without being refreshed, then there is again no dependency
on networking at the venue.</p>

<p>The server is written in JavaScript, and can be run using <a
href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, which may need to be installed first.
Create a folder containing <code>server.js</code> and a web page
<code>index.html</code>, run the server with the command <code>node
server</code>, and then view the page by visiting
<code>http://localhost:8080/</code> with a browser.</p>

<p>The server delivers pages using XHTML to get immediate feedback on syntax
errors from the browser, and has features to guard against problems which might
arise from developing on one platform and publishing on another. The details are
described in the comments in <code>server.js</code>.  The server is sufficiently
simple that it can be customized further with only a little JavaScript
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="viewer">The viewer</h2>

<p>The viewer is the script <code>wrap.js</code>.  A simple presentation
consists of a folder containing <code>wrap.js</code>, and a web page
<code>index.html</code> with an inclusion like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;script src='wrap.js'>&lt;/script>
</pre>

<p>The viewer has been tested on recent Chrome and Firefox browsers.  No attempt
has been made to support old or unusual browsers, but the viewer keeps to the
relevant standards, so that any up-to-date browser should work.  If a
presentation is made available to an audience, either they can be told to use a
suitable browser, or they can be given a PDF version.</p>

<h2 id="skeleton">The skeleton</h2>

<p>The simplest form of a one page presentation is:</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
&lt;head>
&lt;title>Title&lt;/title>
&lt;script src='wrap.js'>&lt;/script>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>

&lt;section>
&lt;h2>Slide&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Paragraph&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>

&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>This can can be used as a skeleton starting point for a new presentation by
copying it into a file <code>index.html</code>.  If it is viewed, its one slide
is displayed in the default web-page style, which does not yet look much like a
presentation.</p>

<p>This is a normal HTML5 web page, with each slide in the presentation being
written between <code>&lt;section></code> and <code>&lt;/section></code> tags.
The attribute <code>xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</code> on the
<code>html</code> tag is not strictly necessary.  However, if the provided
custom server is used for development, it is needed so that the server can
deliver the page as XHTML, a strict variant of HTML which ensures that any
syntax error is reported immediately by the browser.</p>

<h2 id="slides">Slides</h2>

<p>Wrap supports the idea of organising a presentation as a series of slides, in
the traditional style.  However, there is no desire to curb creativity by
forcing the author into a mold.  An unconventional presentation could consist of
a single slide with a complex custom interactive behaviour.</p>

<p>It is assumed in this documentation that a presentation is going to be
authored directly in HTML by writing a plain text file using an ordinary editor.
The restrictive XHTML variation is recommended, in order to ensure correctness,
which makes various subtle problems a lot less likely.  But XHTML is fussy, like
a programming language so, as with programming, instant feedback on syntax
errors is needed.  That's why the custom web server is provided.</p>

<p>However, any approach can be taken to the production of syntactically correct
HTML.  Some text editors such as <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> have
extensive support for web authoring.  Alternatively, a presentation can be
authored in a markdown language or, to ensure that the whole of HTML is
available, a templating language such as Pug can be used.</p>

<p>authoring via editor with help or specialized
editor brackets, or sufficiently good markdown translator or templating
language.</p>

<p>  If there are multiple slides, PageDown (or
right arrow, down arrow, space, enter) takes you to the next one, and PageUp (or
left arrow, up arrow, backspace) takes you to the previous one.  A clicker
normally sends PageDown and PageUp signals, so that can be used too.</p>
