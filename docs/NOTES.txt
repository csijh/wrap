Editor notes
------------

There's a good start in wrap2.
Aims:
   keeps tags paired and nested at all times
   within that restriction, keep irritation low
   keep the amount of typing low, similar to using markdown

Typing < inserts <></>
Typing < with a selection ... inserts <>...</>
Typing < then escape removes both tags and inserts &lt;
Typing > not in a tag inserts &gt;
Typing > within a tag moves you to just after the tag (typing <p> feels normal)
Typing / inside a tag takes you to its pair
Deleting any of </> removes the tag pair
To move a close tag, cut-and-paste content to move it either side
Cut leaves behind any unpaired tags
Paste from somewhere else removes any unpaired tags before insertion
Typing & inserts &;
Typing escape just after & changes &; to &amp;
Tags/entities are painted red if the name is not recognised
Content is painted red if it is a no-content element
For self-closing elements, <br></br> becomes <br/> on saving, reverse on loading

Implementation: gap buffer (or doubly linked list) of tags, each with a position
in the text and a pointer to its pair.  Positions are negative from the end for
tags which are after the current edit position.
